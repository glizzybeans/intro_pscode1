Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

Hint: Loops

Set currentBox to x times 2
set x to number of scans

The customer scans item.
x increases by 1

newBoxFunction
Print "Box contains 0 items"
Print "Please scan item"

scanFunction
Print "Box contains" currentBox
Print "Please scan item"

repeat scanFunction until currentBox = 50

fullFunction
When currentBox = 50
Print "Box is FULL"
Print "Please start a NEW BOX"

return to newBoxFunction
